= Year 8 IST - Object Activities =

== Instructions ==

All these tasks should be completed in separate HTML files in your `Object Activities` ED STEM workspace. Name each file `activityX.html` (e.g. activity1.html, activity2.html, etc.).

== Task One ==

Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipe.

It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).

Alternatively, you can use a different type of object. For example, a band name (a string), the music genre (a string), and a list of songs (an array of strings).

On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

[%hardbreaks]
Pancakes
Serves: 4
Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 cups flour
1/3 cup sugar
25g butter

== Task Two ==

Copy and modify the above program so that it displays the recipe in the HTML page instead.

HINT: Use `document.getElementById()` and `.innerHTML`

Alternatively, you can research about https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodes.asp[JavaScript and DOM Nodes on w3schools^]

It should roughly follow this format:

[%hardbreaks]
<h1>Pancakes</h1>
<p>Serves: 4</p>
<h3>Ingredients<h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
  <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
  <li>25g butter</li>
</ul>

== Task Three ==

Copy and modify the above program so that it uses an array of at least 3 objects, and displays each of them.

You should include:

- A function to create an object (i.e. use an object prototype)

- A function to display an object in the HTML page

- A loop that goes through each object in the array, calling the function above.
