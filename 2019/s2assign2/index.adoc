== Changelog ==

This assignment was last updated on *Thursday 5 September 2019*.

== Task Overview ==

This assignment requires you to implement a game of your choosing (with some restrictions/guidelines) in JavaScript.

NOTE: When asking previous cohorts for their feedback about this course, a common bit of feedback has been to include fewer replication assignments and more open-ended assignments (similar to the major web design project we completed last semester). The students have spoken and we have listened, with this more open-ended JavaScript assignment allowing you to select and implement a game of your choice.

== Task Description ==

You need to select a game and then implement this game in JavaScript. The game must be an existing well-known game, and cannot be a custom game which you have devised. That said, you can implement an existing game and put your own spin on it (e.g. custom features, levels, etc.) but the implementation, as a whole, needs to largely be true to the existing game.

There are certain minimum requirements which the game must satisfy:

* be able to display the player's name and score.
* keep track of the player and their score.
* involve HTML elements which the user interacts with through the web page, and you manipulate through JavaScript.
* be developed in pure JavaScript without any third-party frameworks (e.g. jQuery, Prototype).

You are free to select a game of your choosing, but you need to make sure that it's within your skill and ability level. There are no marks for complexity of the game which you choose and implement, unless you intend to target the extension/enrichment band. This makes the assignment accessible for all students, while also providing an opportunity for those students who would like an additional challenge to attempt a more advanced and complex project.

In order to pass this assignment with a mark of 50% or greater you must have a reasonably working game (see the marking guidelines), so we encourage you to attempt a game which you will find challenging, but not unachievable.

Here are some examples of games you may wish to attempt, depending on your skill and confidence level with JavaScript programming.

=== Beginner Level ===

* *Blackjack:* Player vs. player, or player vs. computer for a slightly more challenging project.

* *Click the Dot:* Have a dot (circle) randomly appear on the screen in a different location every second, and see how many times the player can click the dot in 30 seconds.

=== Intermediate Level ===

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)[Hangman^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four[Connect Four^]

=== Advanced Level ===

It is expected students wishing to achieve a mark in the extension/enrichment band would attempt a project with more complexity, most likely involving graphics manipulation as well. *If you attempt an advanced level project then you may also use HTML5 elements and associated JavaScript programming.*

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)[Snake^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris[Tetris^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man[Pac Man^]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders[Space Invaders^]

...or another "arcade" style game (see the arcade machine outside SC304 for more ideas...).

NOTE: All the above are just suggestions — you can chose any other games too. However, you cannot do Whack-A-Mole, Rock Paper Scissors, Battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe, The Memory Game, or Guess the Number as these have all been done either in class this year, or as assessment tasks in previous years.

This is an individual project. You are welcome to collaborate and help each other, but all work must be your own. If any of your work is copied (either from another member of the class, or from a third party such as a book or the internet) then make sure you reference the source of the material, otherwise it will be considered plagiarism and you will receive zero.

Most games you can think of will already have been developed in JavaScript with solutions available online. *You must write your own implementation of the game, and all work must be your own* (with the exception of little bits and pieces which you may use from elsewhere, if needed, with references - but these must only be relatively very small and non-important parts of your total assignment, as you won't receive marks for code you didn't write yourself). *We will be actively checking the originality of your submitted code.*


== Submission Instructions ==

=== Proposal ===

*Weight:* 0% +
*Due:* Monday 23 September 2019 (Week 10) by 8:45am

Intended to promote early thought, the proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from your teacher before you proceed to design. By the proposal’s deadline, send an email to your teacher describing one or more ideas that you have for your final project. Make sure you explain the motivation behind each of your ideas (i.e. why it interests you). Treat this requirement as an opportunity for counsel. Certainly include any questions or concerns that you have in this email.

The subject line of your email should be *Proposal*.

While you are encouraged to provide multiple ideas for teacher feedback, if you are set on a single idea then it is okay to just send through that idea - bearing in mind that this section is worth 10% of your semester assessment so you would need to include a fairly detailed rationale for that one and only idea (i.e. several paragraphs, ≈100 words per paragraph as a guide).

On the other hand, if you have multiple ideas (we suggest a maximum of three) then you can include a shorter rationale for each of those ideas (i.e. one paragraph, ≈100 words per paragraph as a guide).

In your rationale you should also comment upon your ability to complete your chosen project, given your current level of knowledge of JavaScript. Also mention whether you will need to do any additional independent research or study to learn new concepts which you currently do not know.

You will then receive an email back with feedback and/or approval for your idea.

This is not worth any part of your formal assessment, but does count towards your effort grade for the subject.


=== Project Status Update ===

*Weight:* 10% +
*Due:* Monday 21 October 2019 (Week 12) by 8:45am

Not only is the status report intended to keep the teacher apprised of your progress, it is an opportunity to keep yourself on track. You will need to provide a short 200 - 300 word email of your progress to your teacher. Your email should address the following aspects (called wins and blockers):

* *Wins:* What have you done so far? What is still to do?

* *Blockers:* What challenges have you encountered? How were they overcome? Do you need any help with particular aspects?

* *Questions:* Do you have any questions or feedback you would like? This can help your teacher prepare to provide you with help during your future project lesson.


=== Implementation ===

*Weight:* 50% +
*Due:* Monday 4 November 2019 (Week 14) by 8:45am

Your assignment must be contained within an ED STEM workspace named Assignment 2 and the first file of the project must be named `index.html` (you can have additional files, if needed, or just this single file).

To submit your assignment you do not need to do anything, we will view your submission in your ED workspace. However, you *must not* change your workspace after the due date and time. We can see the revision history on your workspace and will be actively checking the last time you modified the workspace.

*Late submissions will incur penalties as per the school assessment policy:* For assignments and non-test events a late work penalty of 10% of the total possible mark will be incurred for each day late if work is not submitted on the due date. A loss of 30% is incurred if work due on a Friday is not submitted until the following Monday. After one week (7 days) the item will be awarded a mark of zero.

=== Draft Submissions ===

Given the custom nature of this project we will not have formal draft submissions. However, you are encouraged to ask your teacher to review your assignment during the allocated project lessons for feedback. You are also welcome to get feedback during the after school or lunchtime IT tutorial sessions.

*EXTENSION/BONUS BAND*

*Submissions in this mark range will:*

• meet all the requirements of the 21 - 24 mark band.

*In addition, submissions in this mark range will:*

• be the implementation of a complex game which may include graphics manipulation, the implementation of a computer-based AI player, and/or other advanced features.

Remember, you can only use pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. No jQuery or similar frameworks are permitted.

Students who wish to attempt this band should speak with their teacher to ensure that their chosen game is sufficiently complex, but will also be achievable for their skill level.
.^|25

.^|
*Submissions in this mark range will include all of the following:*

• (A) a fully working set of source code files.

• (B) excellent code style, in the form of code comments, use of whitespace, and spacing in the code.

• \(C) proper and appropriate naming of all variables, functions, objects, etc.

*In addition, submissions in this mark range will include:*

• appropriate use of functions to minimise repetition of code and to properly organise code.

• appropriate use of variable scope, using local variables where possible and only using global variables where absolutely necessary.

• use of appropriate control structures, particular if statements and loops (preferably, `for` loops where possible).

• not include repetitive sections of code which could have been avoided through better use of data structures such as arrays or control structures such as loops.

• appropriately use data structures such as arrays to store data about the game, rather than relying on the user interface state. For example, in a game of noughts and crosses if the game is reliant on parsing the values located within HTML elements to determine the state of the game then your game will not meet this criteria. Instead, the game state should be stored within a programmatic data structure - such as an array.

• be able to display the player's name and numerical score.

• keep track of individual players and their numerical scores.

• HTML elements which the user interacts with through the web page, and you manipulate through JavaScript.

• be professionally presented.

• not crash or provide unusual error messages (for example, in the JavaScript console).
